  This project focuses on the NBA and data related to that. Specifically, trying to answer the following questions: the impact of total number of missing players per team per season and its relation to team success, how players' salary impact attendance to games, and lastly, possible correlations regarding performance to one's age and amounts of games played. 
  
   
   There are many reasons players may end up missing games, and the quantity of players missing games will differ per team per season. Taking a deeper look into this may give insight to the possibility of finding a correlation between total number of missing players per team per season to different teams overall season wins. Additionally, we will also take a look at the most common injuries that occured from 2010-2020. The data break down and various charts can be found by clicking on this link https://github.com/paulhji/team_gaap_project1/blob/main/NBA%20Injuries.ipynb. The written analysis can be found from the following link https://github.com/paulhji/team_gaap_project1/blob/main/Analysis%20Section.docx.


There are a lot of different statistics that are tracked within the NBA. Looking at the various correlations allows us to determine what types of player statistics might be related when approaching player success. This was also an exploration into the overall games played by NBA players and how that has impacted minutes as well as the average age of players over the course of 20+ seasons. The code file for this can be found in nba_analysis.ipynb -- Paul Ji.
